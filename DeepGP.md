## Deep Gaussian Process Model

GP: to handle sparse dataset scenarios -> massively missing data  
deep GP: mean function(deep) + covariance function -- propagating uncertainly around network  
idea: automatically determine number of layer and hidden nodes to develop variants of Gaussian process for multiview learning
